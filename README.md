## Motivation

This repository holds a project called [`hAppy`](), created during [Next Level Week #3](https://nextlevelweek.com/inscricao/3). In this bootcamp, we created a platform in which users can share local orphanages along with their visiting rules so that people can connect and inspire underpriviledged youngsters.

You can run it by cloning the repository. Running `cd hAppy/web`,`yarn install` then executing the command `npm run start`.

## Requirements

React-router-dom, leaflet, jest, node and typescript.
